# geonamesr 🌎🔍

`geonamesr` is an R package developed using
[Rcpp](https://www.rcpp.org/), integrated with the [Lucene++
project](https://github.com/luceneplusplus/LucenePlusPlus), designed to
allow users to index and search data from
[Geonames](http://www.geonames.org/) locally. This package contains not
only R functions as a standard package but also provides a
[Plumber](https://www.rplumber.io/) REST API, making data more
accessible and discoverable for R users.
